# Learning Jenkins with C++ and Docker

This project serves as a hands-on guide for learning Jenkins, focusing on integrating it with a C++ project and utilizing Docker for building and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Jenkins: [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)
- Docker: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++): Install a compiler suitable for your platform.

## Project Structure

Describe the basic structure of your C++ project, including key directories and files.

```
project-root/
│
├── src/          # C++ source code
├── include/      # Header files
├── tests/        # Unit tests
├── Dockerfile    # Docker configuration for building the project
├── Jenkinsfile   # Jenkins pipeline script
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```

## Building and Running Locally

Provide instructions on how to build and run the C++ project locally using a simple build system or makefile.

```bash
# Example build and run commands
cd project-root/
g++ -o my_program src/main.cpp
./my_program
```

## Docker Integration

Explain how Docker is utilized in your project. Include details about the Dockerfile, container setup, and how to build/run the project within a Docker container.

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t CPP .
```

### Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run CPP
```

## Jenkins Integration

Describe the steps to set up Jenkins for your project. Include information about configuring Jenkins, creating a pipeline, and triggering builds.

1. Install Jenkins following the [official installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).
2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline project.
3. Configure the pipeline to use your version control system (e.g., Git).
4. Use the provided `Jenkinsfile` in your pipeline configuration.
